# Future Concepts Starter Pack

Purpose: a public, generic portfolio showing concepting, engineering rigor, documentation, and CI practices relevant to staff-level future concepts roles.

What reviewers see quickly:
- briefs/technical_brief_template.md and briefs/executive_one_pager.md
- concepts/ multi-domain concept notes (air, maritime, space)
- studies/ weighted trade study CSV and decision log
- demos/ small Python demos: GPS-denied navigation and a 2D Kalman filter
- qa/ requirements traceability CSV and risk register
- rfi_proposals/ sanitized RFI response template and proposal outline
- CI via .github/workflows/ci.yml and basic quality gates via .pre-commit-config.yaml

Guardrails:
- Public, generic data only. No export-controlled or customer-proprietary information.
- ASCII friendly. Plain text formats.
